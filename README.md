# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon-of-Stroop-effect
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. Look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. I have interpreted results in terms of your hypotheses.
